    "This notebook will present the journey of the group through the data analysis. We show that we :\n",
    "- can handle the data in its size.\n",
    "- understand what’s in the data giving the formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, and so on.\n",
    "- considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to our needs.\n",
    "- have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods we’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.\n",
    "- have a plan for analysis and its communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to our choices that we considered but dropped.\n",
